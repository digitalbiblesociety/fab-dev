The FAB directory primarily consists of content created by members of the Forum of Bible Agencies International (FOBAI) and is intended to help users discover and obtain Scriptures and biblical resources in the language and media of their choice for discipleship, evangelism, and church planting.  Find-A-Bible also features links to print Bibles, print-on-demand Bibles, digital Bibles, audio Bibles, visual Bibles and Bible resources \u2013 in multiple formats."},{title:"Why was Find-A-Bible Created?",icon:"/img/fab_color_globe.svg",description:'The mission of Find-A-Bible is to ensure that the world\u2019s Bibles and great biblical resources are easily found and shared. While it is possible to search for a great many Biblical resources online, the sheer quantity of available content is overwhelming. Consequently, FOBAI launched Find-A-Bible in 2006, and it was maintained by <a href="http://pbti.org" target="_blank">Pioneer Bible Translators</a>. In 2013, FOBAI commissioned the <a href="https://dbs.org" target="_blank">Digital Bible Society</a> (DBS) to recreate Find-A-Bible and maintain a single location on the internet where people looking for Bible resources can identify and obtain them.'},{title:"What makes Find-A-Bible distinctive?",icon:"/img/fab_color_forumn.svg",description:"Find-A-Bible is the single digital platform where the major Bible agencies of the world and their affiliates have agreed to collaborate together to ensure that all Bibles and biblical resources are easily discoverable \u2013 in every language. Find-A-Bible was built to be a convenient hub delivering fast, accurate, and relevant information with minimal user effort. Also, it serves as a reference point for Bible translation organizations seeking to discover what Bibles have or have not been published in a specific language."},{title:"Who is FOBAI and its members?",icon:"/img/fab_color_group.svg",description:"The Forum of Bible Agencies International (FOBAI) is an alliance of more than 40 leading international Bible agencies and mission organizations that span more than 150 countries.
